Here's a sample `README.md` file for your **LockScreenAuth** project:

```markdown
# LockScreenAuth

A simple lock screen authentication system with server-client architecture using C.

## Features

- 🛡️ User authentication via PIN input.
- 🔒 Server-client architecture for validation.
- 💾 Database (flat file) for storing user credentials.
- 💻 Simple console-based lock screen (client-side).
- 🖥️ Server that validates user PIN and grants access.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Make or CMake for building the project
- **pthread** library (for multi-threaded server support)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LockScreenAuth.git
   cd LockScreenAuth
   ```

2. Build the project:
   - Using CMake:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

   - Or using Makefile:
     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./build/server
   ```

4. Run the client (lock screen):
   ```bash
   ./build/client
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server first, which listens for incoming client connections.
2. Run the client, which will prompt you for a PIN.
3. The server validates the entered PIN against the `users.db` file.
4. If the PIN is correct, access is granted; otherwise, the client is prompted to try again.

## Configuration

- The server listens on port `8080` by default.
- The `users.db` file stores the user's PIN in plaintext (for simplicity). You can modify this to store hashed values for better security.
